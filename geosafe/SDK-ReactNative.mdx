## ACT GEOSAFE – React Native SDK 

#### Document Version: 1.0 

#### SDK Version: 1.1.12. + 1.15 

### Overview  

The `ACT GEO React Native` SDK provides seamless integration with the ActGeo platform, enabling location-based services and monitoring in React Native applications. This SDK bridges native Android and iOS ActGeo functionalities to React Native, offering an easy-to-use API for developers. 

### Key Features 

- **Initialize ActGeo SDK:** Configure and set up the SDK with your API credentials. 

- **Real-Time Location Monitoring:** Start and stop location tracking with simple commands. 

- **Location Validation:** Check the current location's status. 

- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS. 

### Installation 

```javascript 
npm install react-native-actgeo 
```

### Usage 

```javascript 
import { 
  initSDK, 
  start, 
  stop, 
  sendLocationCheck, 
  destroy, 
} from 'react-native-actgeo'; 
```

### Initialise SDK 

Initializes the SDK with the necessary configuration parameters. 

```javascript 
initSDK( 
    apiKey: string, 
    baseURL: string 
): Promise<void>; 
```
### Parameters 

- **apiKey** (string): The API key for authentication. (Required) 

- **baseURL** (string): The base URL of the service. (Required) 

### Returns 

A Promise that resolves when the SDK is successfully initialized or rejects with an error. 

### Usage Example 

```javascript 
import { initSDK } from 'react-native-actgeo'; 
 
// Initialize SDK 
initSDK( 
  "your-api-key", 
  "https://example.com" 
).then((result) => { 
  console.log("SDK initialized:", result); 
}).catch((err) => { 
  console.error("SDK initialization failed:", err); 
}); 
```

### Starts the location monitoring 

```javascript 
start(): Promise<string>; 
```

### Returns 

A Promise that resolves with a confirmation message (string) when the monitoring starts successfully or rejects with an error. 

### Usage Example 

```javascript 
import { start } from 'react-native-actgeo'; 
 
// Start location monitoring 
start() 
  .then((message) => { 
    console.log("Location monitoring started:", message); 
  }) 
  .catch((err) => { 
    console.error("Failed to start location monitoring:", err); 
  }); 
```

### Stops the location monitoring 

```javascript 
stop(): Promise<string>; 
```

### Returns 

A Promise that resolves with a confirmation message (string) when the monitoring stops successfully or rejects with an error. 

### Usage Example 

```javascript 
import { stop } from 'react-native-actgeo'; 
 
// Stop location monitoring 
stop() 
  .then((message) => { 
    console.log("Location monitoring stopped:", message); 
  }) 
  .catch((err) => { 
    console.error("Failed to stop location monitoring:", err); 
  }); 
```

## Usage Example 

```javascript 
import { destroy } from 'react-native-actgeo'; 
 
// Destroy the SDK instance 
destroy() 
  .then((message) => { 
    console.log("SDK successfully destroyed:", message); 
  }) 
  .catch((err) => { 
    console.error("Failed to destroy SDK:", err); 
  }); 
```
 
Requests the current location status 

Requests the current location status based on the provided account ID and reason for lookup. 

```javascript

  accountId: string, 
  reasonForLookup: Int32 
): Promise<string>; 
``` 

## Parameters 

- **accountId (string):** The account ID associated with the location check. (Required)
