## **Overview**
**_ACTGeoSDK_** is an Android SDK designed for compliance purposes. This SDK ensures that the end user's location complies with regulatory requirements by performing checks and providing the necessary feedback to your application.

## **Integration**

### **Manual Integration** 

#### **1. Download the SDK**

Obtain the latest version of the **_ACTGeoSDK_** from Fantastic Tech

#### **2. Add the SDK to Your Project**

- Save the downloaded .aar file into the application module’s lib folder (usually you can find it at app/libs, if it does not exist, create the lib folder within the app folder). 
- Open the application module’s build.gradle file (usually you can find it at app/build.gradle).
- In the dependencies section, add the following line:
```gradle
implementation(fileTree(mapOf("dir" to "libs", "include" to listOf("*.jar", "*.aar")))) 
```
- As the SDK is included as a .aar file, you need to manually add the used dependencies if they are still not used:

```gradle
// Android 
 implementation(libs.androidx.core.ktx) 
 implementation(libs.androidx.appcompat) 
 implementation(libs.androidx.arch.coretesting) 
 implementation(libs.kotlin.coroutine) 
 implementation(libs.kotlin.coroutinetest) 
 implementation(libs.material) 
  
// Play Services 
 implementation(libs.playservices.core) 
 implementation(libs.playservices.location) 
  
// Retrofit 
 implementation(libs.retrofit) 
 implementation(libs.retrofit.converter.gson) 
 implementation(libs.okhttp) 
 ```

- For testing purposes, you also can add the following dependencies: 

```gradle
// JUnit 
 testImplementation(libs.junit) 
  
 androidTestImplementation(libs.androidx.espresso.core) 
 androidTestImplementation(libs.junit.ext) 
  
// Mockito 
 testImplementation(libs.mockito.core) 
 testImplementation(libs.mockito.kotlin) 
 testImplementation(libs.mockk) 
```
- Press the Sync Now link at the top or select File/Sync Gradle files menu to ensure that all the gradle dependencies are synced. 

 ### **Import the SDK**

Import the necessary classes into the files where you need to use the SDK.

## **Usage**

### **1. Configuring SDK**

You can configure the SDK in two ways:

#### **Via** AndroidManifest.xml:

Add your configuration values to the manifest file (app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml):

```xml
<meta-data 
     android:name="com.fantastic.sdk.API_KEY" 
     android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE" 
 /> 
  
<meta-data 
     android:name="com.fantastic.sdk.BASE_URL" 
     android:value="YOUR_BASE_URL_GOES_HERE" 
 /> 
  
<meta-data 
     android:name="com.fantastic.sdk.ACCOUNT_ID" 
     android:value="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_GOES_HERE" 
 /> 
```

#### **Via Code Injection:**

You can also inject the configuration directly when initializing the **LocationHandler** instance using the **getInstance** methods:

````kotlin
ApiKeyHolder.apply {
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    baseUrl = "https://api.example.com"
    accountId = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" // Optional
    tokenLifespan = 30 // Optional
}
val locationHandler = LocationHandler.getInstance(
    context = applicationContext,
    apiKeyHolder = ApiKeyHolder
)

````

### **2. Create LocationHandler Instance**

Create the **LocationHandler** instance in your ViewModel or application code based on your configuration approach.

- Using **Manifest** Configurations:

````kotlin
private val locationHandler = LocationHandler.getInstance(applicationContext)  
````
- Using an **API Key Holder** Object:

````kotlin
ApiKeyHolder.apply {
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    baseUrl = "https://api.example.com"
    accountId = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" // Optional
    tokenLifespan = 30 // Optional
}
private val locationHandler = LocationHandler.getInstance(
    context = applicationContext,
    apiKeyHolder = ApiKeyHolder
)

````

### **3. Initialise SDK**

The **initialize** function is used to initialize the SDK and ensure it is ready for use. This function executes asynchronously and notifies the caller when the initialization process is complete. 

````kotlin
fun initialize(callback: (isInitialized: Boolean) -> Unit)
````

##### **Parameters**

- `callback: (isInitialized: Boolean) -> Unit`: A callback function that is invoked once the initialization process completes.

##### **Usage**

Call the **initialize** method at the start of your application or when preparing the SDK for use. Use the callback to check if the SDK was initialized successfully.

````kotlin
locationHandler.initialize { isInitialized ->
    if (isInitialized) {
        println("SDK initialized successfully!")
        // Proceed with using the SDK  
    } else {
        println("Failed to initialize the SDK.")
        // Handle initialization failure  
    }
}

````

### **4. Location Checks**

Location checks can be performed through **on-demand checks** or **continuous checks**.

#### **4.1. On Demand Checks**

#### **Start Location Checks**

Once the SDK is initialised, you can start the location checks by observing the results in the **LocationHandler** instance.

````kotlin
fun start()
````

##### **Usage**

````kotlin
fun onStartClicked() { 
     locationHandler.start() 
 } 
````

#### **Observe the results**

Start a new coroutine scope where you can collect the results:

````kotlin
init { 
     viewModelScope.launch { 
         locationHandler.result.collect { 
             // process the result 
         } 
     } 
 } 
````

#### **Stop On Demand Checks**

To stop location monitoring, use the **stop** method.

````kotlin
fun stop()
````

##### **Usage**
````kotlin
fun onStopClicked() { 
     locationHandler.stop() 
 } 
````

#### **Request Location Status**

You can request the current location status by calling the **requestForLocationStatus** method on the IO thread. This method will return the result of **LocationCheckResult** via a returning value, after you might want to go back to the main thread to process the value (or use a MutableStatusFlow).

If **requestForLocationStatus** is called too quickly after starting the service, the **LocationCheckResult** instance in the SDK may not have been able to retrieve the devices' location, and it will return null.  If this is the case, after a short period of time (3 seconds) try recalling the **requestForLocationStatus** method, or after the first location fix is received.

````kotlin
suspend fun requestForLocationStatus(
    accountId: String,
    reason: ReasonForLookup
): LocationCheckResult?
````

##### **Parameters**

- `accountId: String?`: The account identifier for which location checks are being performed.
- `reason: ReasonForLookup`: An enumerated value or object indicating the reason or purpose for performing the location checks.

##### **Return**

- Returns a **LocationCheckResult** object containing the location check details. It can be null if no result is available.

##### **Usage**

````kotlin
fun onSendRequestClicked() { 
     scope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) { 
         val result = locationHandler.requestForLocationStatus( 
             accountId = accountId, 
             reason = reasonForLookup 
         ) 
         resultFlow.emit(result) 
     } 
 } 
````

#### **4.2. Continuous Checks**

#### **Start Continuous Location Checks**

The **startContinuousChecks** function initiates a continuous process to periodically perform location checks. This function allows for callback execution at regular **intervals**, upon completion, or in the event of an error.

````kotlin
fun startContinuousChecks(
    interval: Long,
    accountId: String?,
    reasonForLookup: ReasonForLookup,
    onInterval: (LocationCheckResult?) -> Unit,
    onError: (Throwable?) -> Unit
)
````

##### **Parameters**

- `interval: Long`: Defines the time interval, in milliseconds, between each periodic location check.
- `accountId: String?`: The account identifier for which location checks are being performed. This parameter is optional and can be null.
- `reasonForLookup: ReasonForLookup`: An enumerated value or object indicating the reason or purpose for performing the location checks.
- `onInterval: (LocationCheckResult?) -> Unit`: A callback function invoked at each interval. It receives a LocationCheckResult object containing the results of the periodic check, or null if unavailable.
- `onError: (Throwable?) -> Unit`: A callback function triggered in case of an error. It receives a Throwable object containing details of the error, or null if no specific error information is available.

##### **Usage**

````kotlin
val interval = 5 // Selected interval in Sec

val intervalInMillis = interval * 1000 // Convert interval to milliseconds

locationHandler.startContinuousChecks(
    interval = intervalInMillis,
    accountId = "12345",
    reasonForLookup = ReasonForLookup.LOGIN,
    onInterval = { result ->
        println("Interval Update: $result")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        println("Error Occurred: ${error?.message}")
    }
)
````

##### **Behavior**

##### **1. Periodic Execution:**

- Executes the **onInterval** callback at the specified interval.

##### **2. Completion:**

- When the specified duration elapses, the function executes the **onComplete** callback with a list of all collected results.

##### **3. Error Handling:**

- If an error occurs during execution, the **onError** callback is invoked with details of the error.

##### **Notes**

- The timer will run indefinitely at the specified **interval**.
- Proper error handling in the **onError** callback is recommended to handle edge cases or unexpected failures.

#### **Stop Continuous Checks**

The **stopContinuousChecks** function is used to stop an ongoing continuous location check initiated by the **startContinuousChecks** function. It ensures that the timer and any associated operations are properly terminated.

````kotlin
fun stopContinuousChecks()
````

#### **Usage**

````kotlin
locationHandler.stopContinuousChecks()
````

### **5. Clean up when you finished**

Call the LocationHandler’s destroy() method when you have finished working with the SDK. This is good to be done when your ViewModel is also going to be cleared, like in this example:

````kotlin
override fun onCleared() { 
     super.onCleared() 
     locationHandler.destroy() 
 } 
````

Doing this prevents accidentally leaking subscribers or emitters in the SDK as the ViewModel’s lifecycle is bound to the Activity’s or Fragment’s lifecycle.
