## Overview

ACT Geosafe integrates into your applications to provide a seemless geolocation service.

Geosafe verifies the location of your customer at any required point.  These checks also include many anti-fraud detection tools to ensure that your customer is within the required jurisdiction for your product.

The anti-fraud checks also include constant monitoring of your clients actions and activity to prevent account takeovers and user spoofing.
