## Forms Integration 

1. Customer will have a form created with appropriate configurations in his account. 

2. The customer server sends a request for Get form URL. 

3. The customer server receives a response of Get form URL request. 

4. The applicant opens ACT form by URL that was received in response. 

5. The applicant fills the form and submits data to the ACT server. 

6. The ACT form receives response and shows a success message to the applicant. Also there is a possibility to redirect the applicant to the customer page. 

7. Within 2 minutes to 6 hours, ACT server sends the verification webHook to the customer's server.
